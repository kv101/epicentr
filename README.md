**An all inclusive solution to Earthquake prediction, preparedness and remedy.** <br/>
<br/>
Earthquakes are known to be very difficult to predict in advance, the tectonic movements cannot be modeled before hand.
Only when there is the occurence of an earthquake, does the seismograph actually records the magnitude and issue out public alert and warnings.
<br/>
In this project, we are trying to create an all information application that could accurately forecast earthquakes based on various parameters, that can alert the citizens and authorities alike who could be better prepared to cope with the after effects of the calamity.
