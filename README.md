**An all inclusive solution to Earthquake prediction, disaster preparedness and remedy.** <br/>
<br/>
Earthquakes are known to be very difficult to predict in advance especially because the tectonic movements cannot be modeled before hand.The current state-of-the-art relies on seismographic readings on reccording magnitude of the quake at the epicentre and is subsequently used to issue warnings and alerts to the nearby areas. The current technique is clearly inefficient for optimal disaster management and leaves a huge scope for improvement.
<br/>
<br/>
In this project, we are trying to create an all information application that could accurately forecast earthquakes based on various parameters, that can alert the citizens and authorities alike who could be better prepared to cope with the after effects of the calamity.
Also as an add on, we would also like to add a remedial functionality that would let the authorities and the affected people to better coordinate to overcome the potential destruction and engage in efficient relief efforts. 
<br/><br/>

**Earthquake Forecast Feature**: We are trying to deploy diverse input features to model the probability of an earthquake at a given location. Some of these features include: <br/>
1) Satellite Images and Remote Sensing : Modelled from real time data
2) Chemical, Geological and Biological precursors: Certain temporal changes in the place that can be linked to an approcahing disaster
3) Disaster history of calamity prone zones
<br/><br/>

**Disaster Preparedness Feature** : After understanding the situation of a particular place, the authorities and the local population would have to undertake certain steps for battling the impending disaster and our product would help them out in this regard. This feature could essentially be useful in the following ways:
<br/>
1) Integrated Public Alert System : Can be linked to social media for wider outreach
2) Evacuation

**Disaster Remedy Feature** : After the advent of the disaster, remedial measures can be greatly helped with this feature. Some of its characteristics are: <bf/>
1) Rescue operations : Worstly hit areas can be recognized via social media data mining and equitable distribution of resources for rescue operations can be undertaken
2) Disruption in Transport Infrastructure : The authorities would be better equipped with diverting traffic and rescheduling public transportation. Live transport data can directly be taken from Live Maps and integrated into our product.
3) Current State: Akin to the 'marking as safe' feature in Facebook, this app would have a feature which lets you feed in your current level of safety after the disaster struck and would let your well-wishers and rescue missions know your condition and location for swift action
