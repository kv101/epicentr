**An all inclusive solution to Earthquake prediction, preparedness and remedy.** <br/>
<br/>
Earthquakes are known to be very difficult to predict in advance especially because the tectonic movements cannot be modeled before hand.The current state-of-the-art relies on seismographic readings on reccording magnitude of the quake at the epicentre and is subsequently used to issue warnings and alerts to the nearby areas. The current technique is clearly inefficient for optimal disaster management and leaves a huge scope for improvement.
<br/>
<br/>
In this project, we are trying to create an all information application that could accurately forecast earthquakes based on various parameters, that can alert the citizens and authorities alike who could be better prepared to cope with the after effects of the calamity.
Also as an add on, we would also like to add a remedial functionality that would let the authorities and the affected people to better coordinate to overcome the potential destruction and engage in efficient relief efforts. 
<br/><br/>

**Earthquake Forecast Feature**: We are trying to deploy diverse input features to model the probability of an earthquake at a given location. Some of these features include: <br/>
1) Satellite Images
2) Chemical and biological premarkers
3) Disaster history
<br/><br/>

**Disaster Preparedness Feature** : After understanding the situation of a particular place, the authorities and the local population would have to undertake certain steps for battling the impending disaster and our product would help them out in this regard.
